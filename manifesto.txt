MANIFESTO OF THE COMINTERNALS PARTY

a spectre is haunting linux--the spectre of communism.

among the primary responsibilities of a computer operating system, we are
told, is resource management. the kernel allocates limited resources, such
as CPU time, memory, disk space, and input/output devices, to meet the demand
of user software. it is tasked with ensuring that these resources are
allocated fairly and efficiently, and with balancing the needs of competing
user processes.

then, we might ask, is an operating system not unlike a government? are the algorithms that describe how limited CPU time and memory space are allocated
between threads not serving the same fundamental role as an economic system,
which describes how limited labor and natural resources are allocated between
human beings? might the techniques developed to optimize the performance of
operating systems not also optimize the performance of governments and
economies?

what human concerns might be neglected when governance is thus reduced to an
engineering problem?

source code, the human-readable, textual representation of a computer program,
is filled with human meaning; comments included in the source and the names
given to variables, constants, functions, and other units of code describe the behaviour, purposes, and authorial intent to a human reader. but when source
code is compiled to machine-readable binary, all of this human meaning is
stripped away, replaced with machine meaning.

   *  *  *

the compiler doesn't care what you called a given variable, and it certainly
doesn't read your comments, no matter how much we might wish otherwise.

   *  *  *

two source code files whose human-readable text convey completely different
semantic meanings could nonetheless output identical executable binaries.
